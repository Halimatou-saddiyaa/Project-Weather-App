# Project-Weather-App

The purpose of this project is to present it during a demo session.

The app allows a user to obtain a weather forecast for a particular place by entering a city name in a field.
The user then clicks a button, which displays the temperature and a description of the weather in the chosen city.

This app is based on mock data contained in JavaScript variables â€” not real data from a live or reliable source.

## Improvements

### Short Term:

Add more mock data for different cities

Improve the CSS styling

### Long Term:

Continue developing the project by adding new DOM and JavaScript features

Deploy the project on Netlify

Replace the mock data with real data from an API, like in the TV Show project

## Next Steps

As I move forward with the TV Show project, I plan to apply what I learn there to improve this one

Present the updated project again with the improvements
